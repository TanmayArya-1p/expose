### How the App Works

Expose is a semi-peer-to-peer (semi-P2P) photo-sharing app to synchronize your photo library seamlessly with other users within a session. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- Session Creation: Initiate a session to start sharing photos. Upon session creation, a unique Concat String or QR Code is generated, which other users can utilize to join your session.

- Photo Synchronization: Only photos taken after the session's initiation are included in the synchronization process. 

- Background Operation: The app operates in the background, continuously syncing newly captured photos with all participants in the session. This ensures real-time photo sharing without manual intervention.

- Join a Session: Users can easily join an existing session by entering the provided Concat String or scanning the QR Code. Once joined, their newly taken photos are automatically synced with the session.

### Installation & Setup

1. Download The Latest Release from [here](https://github.com/TanmayArya-1p/expose/releases)

2. Make sure you setup [FRelay](https://github.com/TanmayArya-1p/FRelay) on a machine and port-forward to the Internet using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/)
3. On Installing the App, provide the app permissions for media access and camera access to scan QR codes.
4. If you accidentally decline any requests for permissions, the only way to enable it is to do it manually via settings.
